Audrey's Meatloaf
---------------
Servings: 8
Time: 1 hour

Ingredients:
2 pounds Ground Beef
10 slices Thin/regular Bacon
6 slices White Bread
1/4 teaspoon Seasoned Salt
Freshly Ground Black Pepper
1-1/2 cup Ketchup
1 teaspoon Dry Mustard
1/3 cup Brown Sugar
1 cup (heaping) Freshly Grated Parmesan Cheese
1/3 cup Minced Flat-leaf Parsley
1/4 teaspoon Seasoned Salt
1-1/2 cup Ketchup
1 teaspoon Dry Mustard
6 slices White Bread
10 slices Thin/regular Bacon
6 slices White Bread
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 cup Whole Milk
Tabasco To Taste

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Pour milk over the bread slices. Allow it to soak in for several minutes.
3. Place the ground beef, milk-soaked bread, Parmesan, seasoned salt, salt, black pepper, and parsley in a large mixing bowl. Pour in beaten eggs.
4. With clean hands, mix the ingredients until well combined.
5. Form the mixture into a loaf shape on a broiler pan, which will allow the fat to drain.
6. Line the bottom of the pan with foil to avoid a big mess!
7. Lay bacon slices over the top, tucking them underneath the meatloaf.
8. Make the sauce: add ketchup, brown sugar, mustard, and hot sauce in a mixing bowl. Stir together.
9. Pour 1/3 of the mixture over the top of the bacon. Spread with a spoon.
10 slices Thin/regular Bacon
11. Slice and serve with remaining sauce. Serve with mashed potatoes. Yummy!
12. REMOVE LID BEFORE you turn off heat, or else water will drip back onto bun surface and produce yellowish "blisters" on bun surfaces.
